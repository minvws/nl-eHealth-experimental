# FHIR Examples

The examples are taken from https://www.hl7.org/fhir/immunization-examples.html

I chose the JSON representation of the FHIR data just for ease of development.
Any other valid FHIR data representation (e.g. XML) is also suitable, it does not change the fundamental process of mapping the FHIR defined data fields for the immunization resource to the minimum data set for storage.
